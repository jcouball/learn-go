# Chapter 2: Predeclared Types and Declarations

Go defines predeclared types for booleans, numbers, strings, and a few built-in
interfaces like `error`, `any`, and `comparable`.

## Zero Value

The "zero value" is the default value given to any variable that's declared but not
assigned. Zero values for each type are:

- `bool`: `false`
- Numeric types default to `0`; complex numbers use `0+0i`
- `string`: `""` (empty string)
- `error`: `nil`
- `any`: `nil`
- `comparable`: inherits the zero value of the underlying type

## Literals

Types of literals:

- numeric: integers, floats, runes (single Unicode code points), and complex numbers
- string: interpreted (delimited with double quotes) and raw (delimited with
  backticks)
- boolean: `true` & `false`
- composite: arrays, slices, structs, maps, and interfaces
- function: `func(x int) int { return x * x }`

Interpreted string literals can not include unescaped backslashes, unescaped
newlines, or unescaped double quotes.

## Types

The types supported by Go are:

- Boolean: `bool`, zero value: false,
- Numeric
  - Integers: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`,
    `uint64`, `byte` is an alias for `uint8`. `rune` is an alias for `int32`
  - Platform specific integers: `int`, `uint`, and `uintptr`
  - Floats: `float32`, `float64`
  - Complex: `complex64`, `complex128`
- String: `string`
- Error interface: `error`
- `any` (alias for `interface{}`)
- `comparable` (constraint for types supporting `==`/`!=`)

Strings in Go are immutable.

In Go, you must use explicit type conversion when variable types don't match,
including when only their numeric widths differ (for example, assigning an int32 to
an int64 requires explicit type conversion).

Literals are untyped.

For instance, boolean literals are untyped but only resolve to bool, whereas numeric
literals can become any compatible numeric type.

## Variables

### Declaring with `var`

```go
var x int = 10
```

Omitting the type means the variable gets the literal's default type (`x` is of type
`int`):

```go
var x = 10
```

Omitting the value means to use the zero value (`name` is an empty string):

```go
var name string
```

Declare multiple variables (of the same type) at once. If the explicit type (`int`)
is left off, the type of each variable is inferred by each value. In this form, you
can only specify a single explicit type and it applies to all the variables being
declared.

```go
var x, y int = 10, 20
var name, age = "James", 58
var name string, age int = "James", 58 // INVALID: only 1 explicit type can be given
var name, age int = "James", 58 // INVALID: can not initialize an `int` with a `string`
```

Declare multiple variables (of different types) at once:

```go
var (
    firstName string = "James"
    lastName = "Couball" // Type inferred
    age int = 58
    minScore, maxScore = 90, 95 // Multiple values, type inferred
    father, mother string // Multiple values set to the zero value
)
```

### Declaring with `:=`

Within a function, `:=` is a shorthand version of `var` that lets you declare and
initialize variables with type inference.

Declaring a single variable:

```go
var name = "James" // Using var
x := "James" // Equivalent using :=
```

Declaring multiple variables:

```go
var name, age = "James", 58 // Using var
name, age := "James", 58 // Equivalent using :=
```

You should only declare multiple variables on the same line when assigning multiple
values returned from a function or the comma ok idiom.

## Constants

`const` is a way to declare a value as immutable. It's used just like `var`.

Constants give names to literals. They can only hold values that the compiler can
figure out at compile time. Go doesn't provide a way to specify that a value
calculated at runtime is immutable.

There are no immutable arrays, slices, maps, or structs and no way to declare that a
field in a struct is immutable.

Constants can be typed or untyped. An untyped constant works exactly like a literal.

## Naming Variables and Constants

Variable and constant names must start with an underscore or letter and can contain
underscores, letters, and digits. Here, letter and digit means any Unicode character
that's considered a letter or digit.

Idiomatic Go uses camel case for both variable and constant names.
