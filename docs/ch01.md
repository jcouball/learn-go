# Chapter 1: Setting Up Your Environment

This chapter is a lightweight checklist for getting the toolchain ready before diving
into the examples.

## Environment Checklist

* Install Go (matching the version used in the book) and verify with `go version`.
* Configure your editor or IDE with Go tooling so that `gofmt`, `goimports`, and
  linting run automatically.
* Install Vale for prose linting of documentation files and verify with `vale
  --version`.
* Clone this repository, run `make list`, and execute one of the example targets to
  confirm everything is wired up.

Once your environment passes the smoke test you can move straight into the
predeclared types material in Chapter 2.
